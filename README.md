This project was cleaned for submission â€” large folders like `node_modules` and build artifacts were removed to reduce zip size.

1. Open a terminal in the project root.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to launch the development server.

> Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
